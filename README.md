This code was created by Gernot Pucher as classwork for the class "Programming Languages for Data Science" at the University of Dundee.
The code simulates a zombie outbreak. Based on some simple rules of interaction between human and zombie agents, their population increases or decreases over time.
To start the simulation, save all files into a common folder and execute start.py
Befor starting the program, please check config.py. This file controls the simulation parameters.
The parameter "START" determines if the program produces a Monte Carlo Simulation or an animated plot.
For a more detailed description of the code, some context and references, please see the report that was produced as part of the assignment.
